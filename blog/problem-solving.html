          <p>
            Pseudocode is a way to provide descriptions/notes about each part of
            the code itself and explains what each part does allowing developers
            and yourself to understand what is going on.

          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            Rubber duck debugging is a method of debugging code by articulating
            a problem in spoken or written natural language. The name is a
            reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a
            programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by
            forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck. Many
            other terms exist for this technique, often involving different
            (usually) inanimate objects, or pets such as a dog or a cat.

          <br />
          <p>
            Error messages generally points where the developer did something
            wrong, knowing how to read and interpretated a error message is
            vital as is a great tool for problem solving.

          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            Console log is a great way to print information to check if the code
            is doing what is supposed to do of accessing the parts of the code
            and executing functions, great way to actually see things.

            Google is my shepherd; I shall not want. 2 He makes me to lean down
            in blue screens: he leadeth me beside the knowledge waters. 3 He
            restoreth my memory: he leadeth me in the paths of inter web for his
            name's sake.

          <p>
            Playing around with code is a great way to fix or make problems
            worst, anyway, on the worst-case scenario you learn something, can
            be how to do something or how NOT to do something.

          <br />
          <p>
            Nothing wrong about getting a second opinion, other people can see
            problem from another perspective, is like that idea of “You have to
            leave the island to see the island” other people have an outside
            view. So, asking for help is a “MUST DO”.

          <br />
          <p>
            Asking coaches for help aka “Bring the big gun!” is also great,
            people with experience may solve or lead for the resolution of a
            problem really quick, or make things worst by providing super
            complex, advanced pro, galactical, power level answers that your
            mere mortal brain can't process like a Lovecraftian non-Euclidean
            geometry space. But they will be able to guide you thought this
            universe of madness.

          <p>
            Reflecting and thinking about a thought can lead insights or
            creative ways to go around an obstacle, getting out of the screen
            and walk is a great way to do it or even doing that while washing
            the dishes.
