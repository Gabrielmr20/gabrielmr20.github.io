              What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and ego
              as a result of the core learning?

          <p>
            I’ve learned that my brain likes to put me down but I managed to
            develop strategies to work around that using emotional intelligence
            skills acquired on the course.

            <header>What is the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</header>
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            Empathy to the other, for when they were struggling to help or just motivate.
Self-awareness to respect the needs of my body to have better results

          </p>

          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            The amount of noun programing related contentment, I was expecting to look code every day.
          </p>
          <br />




          <div class="centerbox">
            <header>What were the most challenging aspects of core learning?</header>
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            For sure applying the concepts of what I was learning on daily basis, is like an exercise for itself.
          </p>
          <br />



          <div class="centerbox">
            <header>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</header>
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            I believe that because just being good at coding is not enough anymore, for the scope of projects from now days, communication and health interaction with other beings is a must.
          </p>

          <div class="centerbox">
            <header>Does the time you spent studying core learning feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?</header>
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            Not a waste of time at all, I just think that they should be presented after the coding related parts of the course, coding is really brain demanding, so when I was getting tired, I was jumping to the core parts that don’t demands too much thinking.

          <p>
            Starting with my limitations will be related to coding java script,
            but having multiple minds to ask for solutions or explanations may
            have a turning point on that.
