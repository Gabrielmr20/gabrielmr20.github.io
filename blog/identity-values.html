        </div>

        <p>
          I was born in Brazil and as a Brazilian, a key part of my personality is the willingness to laugh about
          ourselves, our predicaments and political absurdities and to welcome others in on the joke.<br>
          <br>
          A few years back, Brazilians voted a clown into Congress. What was unusual was that he was a real clown by
          profession. Francisco Everardo Oliveira Silva, known by his stage name of "Grumpy" in Portuguese, won on a
          slogan, "It can't get any worse". So, from there you can estipulate that we don't set limits for jokes.<br>
          <br>
          Having the mindset of "It can't get any worse". The only path ahead is improvement even if it means to make
          some
          really doubtful choices.<br>
          <br>
          Hey, the clown actually did good!<br>
          <br>
        </p>

        <div class="centerbox">
          <header>What are my values?</header>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Respect</b> for others and for myself, to respect and be respected.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Honesty</b> and sincerity not ignoring respect.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Integrity</b> to keep by those values, it can be called “value” but that does not mean it have a price.<br>
          <br>
        </p>

        <div class="centerbox">
          <header>What are my strengths?</header>
        </div>
        <br>
        I know a little about a lot, a machinegun of random facts, able to link completely non relate subjects.<br>
        <br>
        There is no way to explain the process, but I can <b>“show”</b> how it works with a game that I've called <b>7
        clicks for
        the
        stars!</b><br>
        <br>
        Is a simple game, if you have a smartphone or a computer with internet connection you can play it. the score
        is set like golf, <b>less is more</b>, get a random subject on Wikipedia like “The golden bird” and using just the
        links inside Wikipedia <b>(you can't use external links or google and can't go back after going inside a link)</b> try
        to reach “Seven Dwarfs”, count each link that you access <b>(this is your score)</b>, so CTRL+F for words that maybe
        are a link, just a hint: dwarfs dig for <b>GOLD</b>…<br>
        <br>
        I use this on every aspect of my communication, creating bridges between me and another person and keep rich
        conversations while I learn a little more with this interaction.<br>
        <br>
        So, summarizing my strengths are <b>“sponge brain”</b> and <b>human skills</b>.<br>
