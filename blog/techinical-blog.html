          <header>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</header>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>Every time website is been created HTML and CSS will be used.</p><br>
        <br>

        <p>Think that a website is like a house, HTML skeletal of that structure. CSS is like the decoration the paint,
          the
          plaster, carpet, furniture etc.</p><br>
        <br>

        <div class="centerbox">
          <header>Control flow and loops</header>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>Control flow is the order in which a process is executed. In programming the code is executed from the first
          line to the last line. Unless changes are made to change the execution order.</p><br>
        <br>

        <p>Loops like the name says are instructions that keeping repeating/looping until a condition is achieved. For
          example, keeps fulfilling fridge until the fridge is full.</p><br>
        <br>

        <div class="centerbox">
          <header>What is the DOM?</header>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>The DOM <b>(Document Object Model)</b> is a programming interface. It takes HTML content and convert that
          into a object
          so JavaScript can access and modify the code.</p><br>

        <div class="centerbox">
          <header>Arrays vs Objects - Accessing data</header>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>Arrays and objects are frequently used in JavaScript, understanding how they work and how to access content
          inside them is vital.</p><br>
        <br>

        <p>An array is an ordered collection of elements mainly values or variables that are
          identified by an index <b>(index indicates the position of the element in the array)</b></p><br>
        <br>

        <p>Creating an <b>array</b> in JavaScript is simple, you can check how it is done here:</p><br>
        <br>

        <pre>
<code>let array = ["item1", "item2", "item3"]
array[1]

// This will return "item2" because the
// index of an array always starts from 0
</code>
</pre>
        <p>The difference of an object and an array is that the data inside the object are known as properties that
          consist
          of a keys and values. The properties can be manipulated using .dot notation and [].</p><br>
        <pre>
<code>let person = {
name: "Gabriel"
age: 100
}

person.name 
// This will return Gabriel using dot notation

person["name"] 
// This will return Gabriel using the [] notation
</code>
</pre>
        <div class="centerbox">
          <header>What are functions?</header>
        </div><br>
        <p><b>Functions</b> in JavaScript are a set of statements that performs a task. It allows to call that piece of code
          instead writing that over and over.</p>
