          Ultimately the goal is to get a job in the tech industry. I do eventually want to get into the cyber security
          field but I would actually enjoy any job tech related.<br>

        <p>
          I would like to develop my technical skills and technical English vocabulary as this is my second language to
          be
          able to explain my ideas and technical problems. <br>

          I don't do good under pressure, doing things on the rush makes me slopy an probably will make it take longer
          than
          should.<br>
          <br>
          How to deal with that? I take the approach that “will take as long as it need” not professional at all, but
          definitely better than delivering a bad job.<br>

          Constantly reminding myself of why I chose to enroll to this programme on first place, suffering on the short
          time
          to achieve a better life. “Suffer is temporary, giving up is forever”.<br>

          Search, read, watch, apply, try, apply again, get out of the screen, don't thing about until thinking about
          again,
          try different, ask and compare.<br>

          Usually, I go straight to google, google does not help? YouTube! Nah, YouTube can't help me, colleagues and
          then
          facilitators. Outside brain inputs, preferable from other people brains can be a great help.<br>

          To point my weakness, to provide me with answers and elaborate that for best understanding if I need, and I
          will ask
          to elaborate, checking up on me is also good, but moderated.<br>
